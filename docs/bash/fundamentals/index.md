# Fundamentals

This section covers the essential building blocks of working with the bash shell. Master these concepts and you'll have a solid foundation for everything that follows.

## Topics

### [Shell Basics](shell-basics.md)

Understanding what bash is, how it relates to terminals and shells, and the difference between interactive and non-interactive usage.

### [Navigation](navigation.md)

Moving around the filesystem with `cd`, understanding paths (absolute vs relative), and using the directory stack with `pushd` and `popd`.

### [Files & Directories](files-directories.md)

Essential file operations: creating, copying, moving, and removing files and directories. Includes `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, and `touch`.

### [Viewing Files](viewing-files.md)

Reading file contents with `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, and identifying file types with the `file` command.

### [Permissions](permissions.md)

Unix permission model: users, groups, read/write/execute bits. Commands include `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask`.

### [Redirection & Pipes](redirection.md)

Controlling input and output: stdin, stdout, stderr, redirecting to files, and connecting commands with pipes.

## Learning Order

These topics build on each other. If you're new to the command line, work through them in order:

1. **Shell Basics** - Understand what you're working with
2. **Navigation** - Learn to move around
3. **Files & Directories** - Work with the filesystem
4. **Viewing Files** - Read what's in files
5. **Permissions** - Control access
6. **Redirection** - Connect commands together

## Key Concepts

By the end of this section, you'll understand:

- The relationship between terminals, shells, and bash
- Absolute vs relative paths
- The filesystem hierarchy
- Standard Unix permissions (rwx)
- stdin, stdout, and stderr
- How to chain commands with pipes

## Try It

Each page includes practical exercises. The best way to learn is by doing - open a terminal and follow along.
